==Model 1 Submitted==
10/9 - Fixed Spelling on Environment, I consistently misspelled it as envivornment
10/9 - Added typechecking for not booleans for ordering operations, not sure why I thought booleans were orderable
10/9 - Added short curcuit logic to and & or before the evaluate of the right operand
10/9 - Changed Environment's evaluate function to only work on addresses, not Lvalues, Chris raised good points

10/10 - Changed Lvalue's delimiter char from '&' to '$'

10/23 - Negative number are to be treated as unary subtraction operations

10/23 - All Models now take in a start and end index, includes attr_reader
10/24 - Model's to_s includes start and end index for testing purposes
10/25 - added default values to the start_index and end_index so i didnt have to rewrite every call within model

10/24 - casts work on just the keyword (e.g. "float 1", "int 1.0" instead of "(float) 1")
10/24 - refactored casting keywords to be actually understandable at a glance
10/24 - swapped precendence order of casting and unary so that casting negatives is possible
